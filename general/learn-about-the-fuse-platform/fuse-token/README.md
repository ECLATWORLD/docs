# Eclat Token (ECLAT)

The ECLAT token is the native currency of the Eclat blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## ECLAT utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Eclat blockchain, ECLAT is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Eclat to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 25k. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.eclatscan.com/](https://status.eclatscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked ECLAT. Which means validators with higher amounts of Eclat staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any ECLAT holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of ECLAT they wish. They receive a share of the Eclat block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As ECLAT is the native currency on Eclat, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, ECLAT transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of ECLAT tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Eclat platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
